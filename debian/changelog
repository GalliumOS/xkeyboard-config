xkeyboard-config (2.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    + Beware of the possible regressions, we're going 3 releases forward
      at once.
  * Rebuild ChangeLog using “git log” on the upstream branch. The NEWS
    file is a bit too lightweight. As a reminder, it's installed as:
      /usr/share/doc/xkb-data/changelog.gz
  * Point to /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/base.lst in README.Debian, thanks to
    Riku Saikkonen for the suggestion (Closes: #487951).
  * Great debian/rules cleanup:
    + Remove deb target, dpkg-buildpackage's -i does the right thing, and
      “-rfakeroot” has been the default for a while.
    + Remove dir target, no longer used.
    + Stop removing rules/compat/base.l[2-4]*.part, they are no longer
      generated automatically.
    + More generically, stop removing files which weren't cleaned, that's
      been fixed.
    + Call touch in clean to restore the empty file which gets deleted by
      quilt when unpatching rules/base.o_k.part; this avoid its showing up
      as “deleted” in “git status”.
    + Try and keep the udeb's size low: Replace multiple spaces with a
      single space character. For this version, installed size goes down
      from 3.5MB to 3.0MB.
    + Additionally, remove comments starting with “//”. Down to 2.6MB, yay.
    + Also don't ship the newly-added pkg-config file in the udeb.
    + Stop removing $(xkb_base)/compiled, it's no longer created.
    + Stop passing --disable-xkbcomp-symlink to configure, it's gone.
  * Merge xsfbs/debian-unstable, which helps avoiding rebuilds.
  * Update download URL in watch file.

  * add debian/patches/130_fix_oss_ctrl_space_accelerator.patch:

      both space and Ctrl + space returned the same XLookupString, which
      prevents space using in some application using
      gtk_action_group_add_toggle_actions to setup Ctrl + space accelerator.
      We lose rctrl accelator but that's better than not having space in
      those applications. Setup it manually will reintroduce

    in packaging.
  * debian/README.Debian: Add a note explaining how to use xkeyboard-config.
